# WATER BODIES CLASSIFICATION BY COLORS

## Description
The project aims to classify water bodies (rivers, lakes and sea water) obtained from Google Satellite Map images, based on their colors in RGB.


## Project Structure
1. Image Processing
- Images to mean RGB list: ./extract_colors_oop.ipynb
2. Writing To CSV
- Writing mean RGB list to CSV: ./mean_rgb_list_to_df.ipynb
3. Training Models
- Machine learning: ./classifier.ipnyb, ./new_classifier.ipnyb
- Best model: ./best_classifier.ipynb
4. Saved Models
- Optimized trained models: ./models

## Application
- Detecting if a real estate property is near a water body from a satellite image
